# 10-Day Weather Web Scraping

## Project Overview
The **10-Day Weather Web Scraping** project involves extracting weather forecasts for the next 10 days from a weather website using Python. The project utilizes web scraping techniques to gather data, which is then cleaned, processed, and visualized to provide a clear weather outlook.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for web scraping and data analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
- **Requests**: For sending HTTP requests to access web page content.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.

## Project Steps

### 1. Web Scraping Setup
- Installed and configured the necessary libraries: BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas.
- Identified the target weather website and the structure of the HTML content to locate the necessary data fields (e.g., date, temperature, weather condition).

### 2. Data Extraction
- Sent HTTP requests to access the weather web page.
- Used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract relevant data such as:
  - Dates of the forecast.
  - Daily temperatures (highs and lows).
  - Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
- Collected the data into a structured format for further processing.

### 3. Data Storage
- Stored the extracted data in a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
- Saved the data to a CSV file to ensure persistence and for future reference.

### 4. Data Cleaning
- Inspected the DataFrame for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
- Performed data cleaning tasks including:
  - Filling or dropping missing values.
  - Converting data types to appropriate formats (e.g., date, temperature).
  - Standardizing text data for consistency.

### 6. Insights and Findings
- Analyzed the visualizations to derive insights about the weather forecast.
- Identified patterns and trends, such as expected temperature ranges and prevalent weather conditions.
- Summarized findings in a clear and concise manner to provide a useful weather outlook.

## Repository Structure
- `web scraping weather/`: Contains the web scraping script.
- `weather data/`: Stores the extracted and cleaned data files.
- `README.md`: Project description and overview.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the web scraping script located in the `web scraping weather/` file:

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of web scraping to gather and analyze weather forecast data. By leveraging Python libraries for data extraction, cleaning, and visualization, the project provides a detailed and actionable 10-day weather outlook.
